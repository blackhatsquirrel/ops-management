Running an efficient and effective SecOps team is arguably the hardest job in IT, let alone security. We’re all really excited about plugging in sexy new boxes with flashy lights but when it comes to actually running the damn things we’re at a loss. Even approaching what you’re meant to do is a nightmare. Does it include patching? Are we a hunt team? Is it more than just a SOC? These are all questions which you’ve no doubt ignored in the interest of avoiding as much work as possible. Fortunately we’ve come up with a very straightforward way of explaining to your boss what you’re meant to do. Whether or not what you’re meant to do is what you’re actually doing is another story… 

A few years ago we were told by a pilot friend of ours about the three principles of aviation. Several thousand beers later we decided this probably isn’t a bad way of looking at security operations.
